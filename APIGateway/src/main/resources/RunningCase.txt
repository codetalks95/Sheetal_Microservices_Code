For calling the Product Services you need to call something like this :-
where 8082 is the port number for API-Gateway and /products/** is the predicate what
we have added in the application.properties and the same is added as RequestMapping
in Product-Service.

http://localhost:8082/products/welcome

For calling the Order Services you need to call something like this :-
where 8082 is the port number for API-Gateway and /orders/** is the predicate what
we have added in the application.properties and the same is added as RequestMapping
in Order-Service.

http://localhost:8082/orders/getMessage
